# MooCalf Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work in 3D modeling, graphic design, and community management. I built this with React and quite a numbver of other libraries and resources. This website was inspired by PedroTech, whose youtube tutorial helped me alot in learning how to make this website. I had a lot of fun making all the smooth animations, a dark/light theme, and an interactive project showcase. Hope you all like it!

## What's Cool About This Site

- **Looks great everywhere**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Dark mode toggle**: Because sometimes you just need to switch things up
- **Animated background**: A subtle grid that adds some life to the page
- **Smooth scrolling**: Everything flows nicely as you navigate around
- **Project showcase**: My favorite projects displayed in a Pinterest-style grid
- **Contact form**: Actually works! (Thanks Formspree)
- **Fast and accessible**: Quick loading and works with screen readers

## What You'll Find Here

- **Hero section**: A quick intro with a button that smoothly takes you to the good stuff
- **About me**: Who I am and what I do (with some animated cards for flair)
- **Experience**: My professional journey and community management work
- **Skills**: What I'm good at, organized into hard skills and soft skills
- **Featured projects**: The projects I'm most proud of
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch with me
- **Full projects page**: Every project I've worked on with detailed info
