# MooCalf Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work in 3D modeling, graphic design, and community management. I built this with React and had a lot of fun adding smooth animations, a dark/light theme toggle, and an interactive project showcase.

## What's Cool About This Site

- **Looks great everywhere**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Dark mode toggle**: Because sometimes you just need to switch things up
- **Animated background**: A subtle grid that adds some life to the page
- **Smooth scrolling**: Everything flows nicely as you navigate around
- **Project showcase**: My favorite projects displayed in a Pinterest-style grid
- **Contact form**: Actually works! (Thanks Formspree)
- **Fast and accessible**: Quick loading and works with screen readers

## What You'll Find Here

- **Hero section**: A quick intro with a button that smoothly takes you to the good stuff
- **About me**: Who I am and what I do (with some animated cards for flair)
- **Experience**: My professional journey and community management work
- **Skills**: What I'm good at, organized into hard skills and soft skills
- **Featured projects**: The projects I'm most proud of
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch with me
- **Full projects page**: Every project I've worked on with detailed info

## Tech Stuff I Used

- **React 19** - Because I like staying current
- **Vite** - Makes development super fast
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling without the headache
- **React Router** - Smooth page transitions
- **Framer Motion** - Beautiful animations
- **Lucide React** - Clean, simple icons
- **Radix UI Toast** - For those nice notification popups
- **Formspree** - Handles my contact form submissions
